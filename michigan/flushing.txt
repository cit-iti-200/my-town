Flushing is a quiet town that has the vibe of a midwestern town- situated near Flint, it has a rustic, vintage feel downtown that I always enjoy. There's Movies in the Park during the summer as well as other town events that are always fun! Bordering on Flint and Mount Morris the communities are now blending.
